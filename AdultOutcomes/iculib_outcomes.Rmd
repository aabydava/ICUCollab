# Overview & Purpose

This report aims to:

1. Describe the cohort of patients in the [SCCM ICU Liberation ABCDEF Bundle Improvement Collaborative](http://www.iculiberation.org/About/collaborative/Pages/default.aspx)
1. Describe the implementation of the [ABCDEF Bundle](http://www.iculiberation.org/Bundles/Pages/default.aspx) over the course of the Collaborative
1. Describe the association between compliance and performance of the ABCDEF Bundle and important ICU outcomes *(outcomes will be detailed in a later section)*

The Collaborative enrolled patients at `r length(unique(demog$hosp_f))` ICUs
across the United States, collecting data during a six-month **baseline** period
and a 14-month **implementation** period. During the six months of baseline data
collection, no changes in usual care were prescribed; during the 14 months of
implementation, sites were encouraged to use the ABCDEF Bundle. Our hypotheses
are that implementation rates improved over the course of data collection, and
that increased compliance with and performance of the ABCDEF Bundle is
associated with better in-hospital outcomes.

Our analysis plan was specified *a priori* and can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GebrA6Lt-rEh70Aw9r4mrhRlggWUfgUl_LaQePOCWZA/edit?usp=sharing), including a history of all changes.

# Definitions of Compliance and Performance

There are six main elements of the ABCDEF Bundle, with element B comprised of
two main components. Definitions of "compliance" (completely following the ABCDEF Bundle protocol as specified, with documentation of each step) and "performance" (performing the main component of the Bundle element, possibly without complete documentation) are detailed below, referring to any single day. For each element,
compliance and performance are only measured if the patient was in the ICU the
full 24 hours; additional eligibility for specific elements are detailed below.

| Bundle element    | Days eligible | Compliant if: | Performed if: |
|-------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| **A: Assess, prevent and manage pain**  | | >=6 documented pain assessments using a validated instrument | *same* |
| **B: Both SAT and SBT** |   |   |   |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SAT | Received continuous/ intermittent sedation | **If safety screen documented:**<br>If screen failed, SAT not performed; if screen passed, SAT was performed<br>**If safety screen not documented:**<br>SAT marked not done due to  failed screen/contraindication | SAT performed and documented |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SBT | On mechanical ventilation | **If safety screen documented:**<br>If screen failed, SBT not performed; if screen passed, SBT was performed<br>**If safety screen not documented:**<br>SBT marked not done due to  failed screen/contraindication | SBT performed and documented |
| **C: Choice of analgesia and sedation** | | >=6 documented sedation assessments using a validated instrument | *same* |
| **D: Delirium - assess, prevent and manage** | | >=2 documented delirium assessments using a validated instrument | *same* |
| **E: Exercise and early mobility** | | **If safety screen documented:**<br>If screen failed, mobility not performed; if screen passed, mobility higher than active range of motion was performed<br>**If safety screen not documented:**<br>Mobility marked not done due to failed screen/contraindication | Mobility higher than active range of motion performed and documented |
| **F: Family engagement and empowerment** | Family present | Family member was educated on ABCDEF bundle and/or participated in at least one of: rounds; conference; plan of care; ABCDEF care | *same* |
| **Overall (complete)** | | All elements eligible to be compliant are compliant | All elements eligible to be performed are performed |
| **Overall (dose)** | | Elements compliant / elements eligible to be compliant | Elements performed / elements eligible to be performed |

# Description of Cohort

`r table_nums("descbase", display = "cite")` describes the demographic and ICU admission characteristics of the patients enrolled during Months 1-20 of data
collection; `r table_nums("descinhosp", display = "cite")` describes in-hospital and discharge characteristics. **Note:** Only patients with at least one day fully in the ICU will be included in the analyses; this reduces the total N to
`r format(sum(demog$icu_days > 0, na.rm = TRUE), big.mark = ",")` patients.

```{r descbase}

## Example for percentiles for each table
bmi_quants <- quantile(demog$bmi, na.rm = TRUE)
hrsmv_quants <- quantile(demog$hrs_invas_mv, na.rm = TRUE)

```

## `r table_nums("descbase")`

Continuous variables are described by the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles, in
that order (50th percentile = median). For example, 25% of patients had a BMI of
`r round(bmi_quants["25%"])` or less; 50% of patients had a BMI of
`r round(bmi_quants["50%"])` or less; and 75% of patients had a BMI of
`r round(bmi_quants["75%"])` or less.

```

## `r table_nums("descinhosp")`

Continuous variables are described by the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles, in
that order (50th percentile = median). For example, 25% of patients had
`r round(hrsmv_quants["25%"])` or fewer hours on mechanical ventilation; 50% of
patients had `r round(hrsmv_quants["50%"])` or fewer hours on MV; and 75% of
patients had `r round(hrsmv_quants["75%"])` or fewer hours on MV.
